    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 8 oz. can crescent dough</li>
            <li>12 hot dogs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>Yellow mustard, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. Separate the crescent dough into 4 rectangles, then use a sharp knife to cut each rectangle into ¼-inch strips the long way. You should have 12 rectangles.</li>
            <li>Use 3 or 4 strips of dough to wrap each hot dog, crisscrossing sometimes and leaving space towards the top for “eyes,” so each dog looks like a bundled mummy.</li>
            <li>Arrange on the baking sheet, brush with butter, and bake until the dough is puffed, flaky, and lightly golden, 15–17 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a toothpick or wooden skewer to create “eyes” on each mummy with mustard. Serve with more dipping sauces, such as ketchup.</li>
        </ol>
